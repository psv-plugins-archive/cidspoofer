Spoof CID (ConsoleID) on PSVITA

Could possibly be used to unban your console from PSN            


add to your \*KERNEL line in config.txt.                  

Simply edit ux0:CID.BIN this file is your CID as raw binary data               
NP Modules store your CID in memory at bootup, so you will have to reboot if you want it to effect those.      

!!Works on 3.65!!
